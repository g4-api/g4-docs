## Description

### Purpose

Ends the current automation session by disposing the active WebDriver and removing its handle from the global registry. This prevents resource leaks and avoids accidental reuse of a stale driver in later steps.

### Key Features and Functionality

| Feature               | Description                                                         |
| --- | --- |
| Safe Teardown         | Disposes the active WebDriver instance and cleans up references.    |
| Idempotent Operation  | Multiple calls are safe; no error if the session is already closed. |
| Registry Cleanup      | Removes the driver from the global registry to prevent later reuse. |
| No Arguments Required | Works on the current session; no configuration needed.              |

### Usages in RPA

| Use Case         | Description                                                            |
| --- | --- |
| Flow Termination | Place as the final step to ensure browser and driver are fully closed. |
| Resource Hygiene | Free system resources in long-running robots or shared environments.   |

### Usages in Automation Testing

| Use Case        | Description                                                                    |
| --- | --- |
| Test Teardown   | Add to teardown stages to guarantee clean driver disposal between test runs.   |
| Isolation       | Reset state before starting a new test requiring a fresh browser session.      |
| Suite Cleanup   | Close all lingering sessions at the end of a test suite to free resources.     |

### Aliases

| Alias     | Notes                                      |
| --- | --- |
| Stop      | Interchangeable with StopFlow.             |
| EndFlow   | Interchangeable with StopFlow.             |

## Examples

### Example No.1

### Stop and Dispose Current Session

Disposes the active WebDriver and removes its registry entry. Use at the end of a workflow to guarantee the browser and driver are fully closed.

**CSharp:**

```csharp
var actionRule = new ActionRuleModel
{
    PluginName = "StopFlow"
};
```

**Java:**

```java
ActionRuleModel actionRule = new ActionRuleModel()
    .setPluginName("StopFlow");
```

**Javascript:**

```js
var actionRule = {
    pluginName: "StopFlow"
};
```

**JSON:**

```js
{
    "pluginName": "StopFlow"
}
```

**Python:**

```python
action_rule = {
    "pluginName": "StopFlow"
}
```

### Example No.2

### Mid-Flow Session Reset Using Stop Alias

Tears down the current browser session mid-workflow using the `Stop` alias before a fresh session is initialized.
Behaviour is identical to `StopFlow`; aliases are interchangeable.

**CSharp:**

```csharp
var actionRule = new ActionRuleModel
{
    PluginName = "Stop"
};
```

**Java:**

```java
ActionRuleModel actionRule = new ActionRuleModel()
    .setPluginName("Stop");
```

**Javascript:**

```js
var actionRule = {
    pluginName: "Stop"
};
```

**JSON:**

```js
{
    "pluginName": "Stop"
}
```

**Python:**

```python
action_rule = {
    "pluginName": "Stop"
}
```

### Example No.3

### Test Teardown Using EndFlow Alias

Disposes the active WebDriver at the end of a test run using the `EndFlow` alias.
Place in the teardown stage to guarantee clean driver disposal between test executions.

**CSharp:**

```csharp
var actionRule = new ActionRuleModel
{
    PluginName = "EndFlow"
};
```

**Java:**

```java
ActionRuleModel actionRule = new ActionRuleModel()
    .setPluginName("EndFlow");
```

**Javascript:**

```js
var actionRule = {
    pluginName: "EndFlow"
};
```

**JSON:**

```js
{
    "pluginName": "EndFlow"
}
```

**Python:**

```python
action_rule = {
    "pluginName": "EndFlow"
}
```
