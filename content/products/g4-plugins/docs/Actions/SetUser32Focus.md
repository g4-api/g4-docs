## Description

### Purpose

The primary purpose of the `SetUser32Focus` plugin is to set keyboard focus on a UI element using the Windows User32 API.
This ensures that the target element becomes active and ready for subsequent user interactions or automated actions.

## Examples

### Example No.1

### Set focus on a UI element

The plugin locates the element at `//input[@id='Username']` using the Xpath locator and sets keyboard focus on it.
The `Locator` property defaults to `Xpath` and does not need to be specified explicitly.

**CSharp:**

```csharp
var actionRule = new ActionRuleModel
{
    PluginName = "SetUser32Focus",
    OnElement = "//input[@id='Username']"
};
```

**Java:**

```java
ActionRuleModel actionRule = new ActionRuleModel()
    .setPluginName("SetUser32Focus")
    .setOnElement("//input[@id='Username']");
```

**Javascript:**

```js
var actionRule = {
    pluginName: "SetUser32Focus",
    onElement: "//input[@id='Username']"
};
```

**JSON:**

```js
{
    "pluginName": "SetUser32Focus",
    "onElement": "//input[@id='Username']"
}
```

**Python:**

```python
action_rule = {
    "pluginName": "SetUser32Focus",
    "onElement": "//input[@id='Username']"
}
```
