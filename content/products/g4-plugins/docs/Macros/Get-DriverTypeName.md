## Examples

### Example No.1

Retrieve the WebDriver type name and log it.
This example uses the `Get-DriverTypeName` plugin to log the WebDriver type name within the automation workflow.

**CSharp:**

```csharp
var actionRule = new ActionRuleModel
{
    PluginName = "WriteLog",
    Argument = "The type name of the WebDriver is {{$Get-DriverTypeName}}"
};
```

**Java:**

```java
ActionRuleModel actionRule = new ActionRuleModel()
    .setPluginName("WriteLog")
    .setArgument("The type name of the WebDriver is {{$Get-DriverTypeName}}");
```

**Javascript:**

```js
var actionRule = {
    pluginName: "WriteLog",
    argument: "The type name of the WebDriver is {{$Get-DriverTypeName}}"
};
```

**JSON:**

```js
{
    "pluginName": "WriteLog",
    "argument": "The type name of the WebDriver is {{$Get-DriverTypeName}}"
}
```

**Python:**

```python
action_rule = {
    "pluginName": "WriteLog",
    "argument": "The type name of the WebDriver is {{$Get-DriverTypeName}}"
}
```

### Example No.2

Retrieve a specific portion of the WebDriver type name using a regex pattern and log it.
This example shows how to use the `Get-DriverTypeName` plugin with a custom regex pattern to log a matched portion of the WebDriver type name.

**CSharp:**

```csharp
var actionRule = new ActionRuleModel
{
    PluginName = "WriteLog",
    Argument = "The matched pattern of the WebDriver type name is {{$Get-DriverTypeName --Pattern:"^Open"}}"
};
```

**Java:**

```java
ActionRuleModel actionRule = new ActionRuleModel()
    .setPluginName("WriteLog")
    .setArgument("The matched pattern of the WebDriver type name is {{$Get-DriverTypeName --Pattern:"^Open"}}");
```

**Javascript:**

```js
var actionRule = {
    pluginName: "WriteLog",
    argument: "The matched pattern of the WebDriver type name is {{$Get-DriverTypeName --Pattern:"^Open"}}"
};
```

**JSON:**

```js
{
    "pluginName": "WriteLog",
    "argument": "The matched pattern of the WebDriver type name is {{$Get-DriverTypeName --Pattern:"^Open"}}"
}
```

**Python:**

```python
action_rule = {
    "pluginName": "WriteLog",
    "argument": "The matched pattern of the WebDriver type name is {{$Get-DriverTypeName --Pattern:"^Open"}}"
}
```

## Parameters
